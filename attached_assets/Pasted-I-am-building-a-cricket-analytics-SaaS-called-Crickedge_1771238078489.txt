I am building a cricket analytics SaaS called Crickedge.

Phase 1: IPL Historical Data Engineering Foundation.

Project Requirements:

1. My IPL JSON files (Cricsheet format) are inside:
   data/raw_json/

2. Create a clean project structure:

   data/
     raw_json/
     processed/

   scripts/

3. Build three Python scripts:

   A) build_metadata.py
      - Loop through all JSON files
      - Extract:
          match_id
          season
          date
          venue
          team_1
          team_2
          toss_winner
          toss_decision
          winner
      - Skip matches with:
          no winner
          DLS method
      - Save as:
          data/processed/match_metadata.csv

   B) build_powerplay_summary.py
      - For each valid match:
          extract first innings overs 1–6
          calculate:
              powerplay_runs
              powerplay_wickets
      - Include:
          match_id
          season
          venue
          batting_team
          bowling_team
          toss_winner
          toss_decision
          final_winner
      - Save as:
          data/processed/powerplay_summary.csv

   C) build_over_state_snapshots.py
      - For each valid match:
          For each innings:
              At end of every over:
                  calculate cumulative:
                      runs_so_far
                      wickets_so_far
              If second innings:
                  compute:
                      target
                      balls_remaining
                      required_run_rate
          Include:
              match_id
              season
              venue
              innings_number
              over_number
              batting_team
              bowling_team
              runs_so_far
              wickets_so_far
              balls_remaining
              target
              required_run_rate
              eventual_winner
      - Save as:
          data/processed/over_state_snapshots.csv

4. Ensure:
   - Code is modular
   - Functions are reusable
   - No data leakage
   - Proper error handling
   - Print summary stats after execution

Do not build ML models.
Do not build UI.
Only build clean data engineering foundation.
