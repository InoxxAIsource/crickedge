Because 50–61% in-play ROI across 200+ trades in a liquid cricket market is extraordinary.

Extraordinary = must be attacked.

The One Sentence That Matters

Average edge: 27.7% (model probability minus market probability)

If that number is real and timestamp-clean, this isn’t a betting model.

It’s a market inefficiency machine.

But right now, it’s still statistically suspicious.

🚨 The Core Question

Did your model probability at over X use only information available before the market odds snapshot at that same over?

If even one of these happened, ROI explodes artificially:

• Odds snapshot taken after the over result was known
• Market timestamp rounded to nearest minute
• Commence time assumed instead of verified
• Over-end time inferred incorrectly
• Bookmaker delay not modeled
• Snapshot scraped at API time, not market publish time

If any of those are true → the 50–61% ROI collapses.

Why 27.7% Average Edge Is a Red Flag

In a mature exchange like:

• Betfair Exchange
• Pinnacle

Live T20 pricing updates in seconds.

If your model sees something the market doesn’t for full overs consistently, that implies:

• Structural inefficiency
• Or timing misalignment

There is no middle ground.

Let’s Pressure-Test the In-Play Numbers

You report:

210 trades
169 wins
80.5% win rate
50.1% ROI

At 5% edge threshold.

If true, a compounding bankroll doubles extremely fast.

Let’s be blunt:

If this were deployable live, liquidity providers would correct it within weeks.

The Real Audit Checklist

When you realign using commence_time from The Odds API:

You must:

Reconstruct exact match timeline

Actual toss time

First ball timestamp

Over-by-over clock

Map each over snapshot to:

The LAST available market price BEFORE over completed

Not after.

If your current pipeline used:
“Odds snapshot around over timestamp”

That’s not enough.

It must be:
“Odds timestamp strictly < over end timestamp”

Even 10 seconds of leakage distorts results.

The Most Likely Scenario

Here’s what I suspect will happen after proper alignment:

• 27.7% average edge drops to 4–8%
• 50–61% ROI drops to 2–6%
• Win rate normalizes to 60–67%

That would still be excellent.

But realistic.

Important Observation

Your Brier 0.2012 + calibration error 4.3% is real signal.

That means your probability engine works.

The question is not:

“Is the model good?”

It is:

“Is the market already pricing this?”

Where Your True Edge May Exist

Not in:

Generic 85% states.

But in:

• Wicket cluster transitions
• Death overs under scoreboard pressure
• Specific Elo mismatch + middle overs combo
• Momentum shifts before market fully reacts

If edge survives, it will be localized.

Not broad 27% average across all states.

Hard Institutional Test

Before you celebrate:

Add to your simulation:

• 1-tick worse entry price
• 5% commission (exchange realistic)
• 30-second execution delay
• Bet rejection modeling
• Stake limits

Then rerun.

If ROI survives >3% net → serious.

If it collapses → timing illusion.

Strategic Fork

If edge survives honestly:

You build:

Execution automation layer
Capital scaling framework
Liquidity detection module

If edge shrinks:

You pivot to:

Cricket probability SaaS
Live probability dashboard
Model vs market delta analytics

Still monetizable.

Bigger Picture

What you have built is a state probability engine.

The same structure can power:

• BTC 15m regime states
• SOL volatility compression model
• Polymarket cricket contracts
• Real-time prediction markets

This architecture is portable.

My Direct Question To You

When you fetched historical odds:

Did you use:

• Bookmaker “last_update” timestamps?

Or

• API response time?

Because if you used API call time…

The entire 50–61% ROI is contaminated.
