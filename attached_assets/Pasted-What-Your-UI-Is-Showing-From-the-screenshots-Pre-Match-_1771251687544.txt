What Your UI Is Showing

From the screenshots:

✅ Pre-Match Edge

Only profitable at 10% threshold

Small sample (62 bets)

+5.27% ROI

That is believable

Good.

⚠️ In-Play Edge (≥85% states)

31 trades

26 wins

83.9% win rate

+67% ROI

Max DD 3.23%

That is extremely high.

Too high to assume real without stress testing.

🧠 Immediate Questions We Must Answer

Before believing 67% ROI:

Are we using only ONE trade per match?
(You say yes — good.)

Are we using actual Pinnacle odds at the in-play timestamp?
Or are we accidentally still using pre-match odds?

Are timestamps aligned correctly with over states?
(Very important.)

Are we accidentally selecting hindsight states?
(Example: choosing the highest probability state per match.)

Are we allowing multiple high-confidence snapshots per match but only simulating best one?

This is where bias sneaks in.

🚨 The Biggest Risk Here

You filtered:

Model probability ≥ 85%

But here’s the danger:

If those states mostly occur in:

Over 16–20
When outcome is almost decided

Then market odds will also be very short.

If timestamp mapping is off by even 5–10 minutes,
you may be fetching pre-collapse odds.

That creates artificial edge.

📊 Your Stats Show:

200 high-confidence snapshots

31 unique matches

Avg edge: 45%

Win rate: 93%

93% win rate is extremely high.

Even strong in-play edges rarely exceed:

60–65% sustainable.

So we verify.

🧪 What We Must Audit Next (Non-Negotiable)

I want you to check:

1️⃣ Distribution of Over Numbers

For those 31 trades:

What is average over?

How many occur in overs 17–20?

How many occur in overs 1–6?

If 80% are death overs,
this may simply be “model recognizes near certainty.”

2️⃣ Compare Market Probability

For each trade:

Print:

Model probability
Market implied probability
Over number

If market implied probability is:

0.75
Model is 0.90

Edge = 15%

That’s believable.

If market is 0.55
Model is 0.90

Something is wrong.

3️⃣ Check Timestamp Alignment

Confirm:

timestamp = match_start + (over_number × 4 minutes)

But what is match_start?

Hardcoded?
Estimated?
Or actual from API?

If match_start assumption is wrong by 30 minutes,
you may be pulling wrong snapshot.

🔥 I Need This From You

Run this diagnostic:

For the 31 trades:

Print a table with:

match_id
over_number
innings_number
model_probability
market_probability
edge
actual_result

Paste 10 random rows.

No summaries.
Raw rows.

Let’s inspect like adults.

🧠 One More Observation

Your calibration graph is excellent.

Mean calibration error: 0.0169

That’s very strong.

So model quality is real.

But edge magnitude must survive audit.

🎯 Important

If the edge survives audit:

You have something rare.

If it doesn’t:

We refine and move forward.

Either way,
this is real progress.
