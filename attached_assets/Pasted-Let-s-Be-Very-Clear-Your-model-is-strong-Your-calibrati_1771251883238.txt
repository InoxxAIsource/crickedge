Let’s Be Very Clear

Your model is strong.

Your calibration is real.

Your high-confidence states are real.

But the 67% ROI is not real.

It is almost certainly caused by timestamp misalignment.

And your own data proves it.

🔎 Why This Is Clearly Timestamp Error

Look at this:

Over 11
Model = 0.9868
Market = 0.4588

That is impossible if the market snapshot is truly in-play.

In second innings:

If model says 98%,
Market would be somewhere like:

0.90 – 0.97 range.

Never 0.45.

That 0.45 probability is clearly:

Pre-match or early innings odds.

So what happened?

Your timestamp logic:

estimated_time = assumed_start + (over * 4 min)


If assumed_start is wrong by 20–40 minutes,
you are pulling:

• Early match snapshot
• Possibly pre-match snapshot
• Not true over-level odds

That inflates edge massively.

🚨 This Is GOOD NEWS

Why?

Because:

The model itself is not the problem.

The infrastructure alignment is.

That’s fixable.

🎯 Yes — Extract Actual Match Start Time

This is the correct next move.

Do not apply hacks.
Do not “fetch worst of 3 timestamps”.
Do not approximate further.

Do it properly.

🏏 Where To Get Accurate Start Time

Cricsheet JSON includes:

info:
    dates
    ...


But not always exact start time.

However:

We can approximate start time much better using:

Match date

IPL typical start time:

Afternoon matches ~ 10:00 UTC

Evening matches ~ 14:00 UTC

Venue time zone

Better approach:

Use The Odds API itself.

Call:

/v4/sports/cricket_ipl/events

This returns event start time (commence_time).

That is exact scheduled start.

Then:

timestamp = commence_time + (over_number × 4 minutes)

Now alignment becomes realistic.

🔥 This Is The Correct Engineering Fix

New logic:

For each match:

Pull commence_time from Odds API events endpoint.

Store it in:
match_metadata_with_start_time.csv

Recalculate:
in-play snapshot timestamp using real start time.

Re-fetch only 31 trades first.

Re-run simulation.

📊 What Will Happen

Most likely:

ROI drops dramatically.

Maybe:

+5%
Maybe flat
Maybe negative

That’s normal.

But if after correction:

ROI still positive (even +3–5%),

Then you truly have something.
